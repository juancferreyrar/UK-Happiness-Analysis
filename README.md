# UK-Happiness-Analysis
Historically, countries have assessed macroeconomic performance indicators that quantify a 
country's economic development over time through financial metrics such as the gross domestic 
product, inflation reports, and consumption. However, in 1972, King Jimgme Singye Wanchuck 
became the catalyst for expanding the scope of what a country's economic development truly 
means. By introducing the term "gross national happiness", he created a focus on the effect of 
individual satisfaction on a country's overall development, and raised the importance of not 
focusing solely on quantitative financial indicators (“Gross National Happiness”). Since this point, 
the recollection of data regarding happiness, satisfaction, well-being, and overall living conditions 
has been increasingly conducted, despite most of the data being self-reported.  

This project aims to assess the relationship between key indicators of self-reported quality of life, 
in four domains (mental well-being as measured by the WHO-5 index, social-life satisfaction, 
overall life satisfaction, and perceived social exclusion) and self-reported happiness among UK 
adults. Using multiple linear regression, each association with happiness will be compared while 
controlling for different control variables that may influence the mentioned variables. These 
domains represent different influences on a person's happiness, and evaluating the domain with 
the strongest association can reveal insights into the influence that each of them has on self
reported happiness.  

For the sample, 2,252 UK individuals' answers are considered as the dataset for the model, with 
the data sourced from a 2011 European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) conducted every four years.
